XPLORER² CHANGELOG
http://zabkat.com
------------------

Here you will find a brief list of items added in each consecutive build.
For more information please refer to the updated full documentation.

NOTE: Items marked with [P] are only in the professional version and [U] for the ultimate version (whatever is [P] is also for [U])


[2.5.0.4] 20 Jun 14 ----------------

* registry setting GAOPT_HOOKWINKEY (=536,870,912) installs a global hook to start xplorer2 with WIN+E key IF xplorer² is set to replace windows explorer. Note that you must leave the background xplorer² process running for this to work. Once you quit with <Alt+X> this shortcut key will open windows explorer. As with all hooks this will somehow impact your computer's performance. This does NOT work if you are using a 32 bit xplorer² on 64 bit windows (explorer replacement doesn't work altogether...)


[2.5.0.0] 13 Apr 14 ----------------

* registry setting GAOPT_NOBROWSECPAN (=524288) controlling whether xplorer² browses into control panel items or not. For windows vista and later these "folders" are better handled by windows explorer

* Edit > Copy names command works in the folder tree too. This in addition to <CTRL+P> command that copies all the active tree branch to the clipboard.

* [P] docking panes have context menu (right click on titlebar) for various operations (dock/float/hide etc)

* custom drive icons are read from AUTORUN.INF files (if present for removable drives)

* corrected PDF text extraction for windows 8.1

* repaired removable media EJECT command from shell context menu 

* picture thumbnails extracted from phones and cameras (thumbnail view and draft QV tab)

* [U] running the professional version in parallel to ultimate doesn't disable fast desktop search

* various small bugs fixed

* [P] robust copy correctly handles file symbolic links (copies the link not the file). Sadly like all symlink operations you must be running as full administrator otherwise you get a funny error message.

* [P] registry setting nUnbufferedCopyMB (default=1GB) sets a size limit above which robust copy is done without buffering. That supposedly fixes problems where your RAM is clogged by extremely huge file copying.

* [P] When robust delete dialog encounters some reparse point (e.g. folder junction or symbolic link) only deletes the reparse information, without touching the target folder. This makes the "confirm folder junctions" checkbox in the dialog rather irrelevant.

* More consistent handling of symbolic links, now you can see previews of them (text or pics) and even search for text in them (in the actual file target)

* New files inserted in a pane (e.g. pasted or dropped) are marked (selected). This lets you see which files were newly added. This feature is controlled by local registry setting variable nMarkNewFileMS which is the time (in milliseconds) xplorer² waits after a file operation is initiated to mark added files. Set this to 0 to disable this new marking feature. If a pane contains a prior selection (>=2 selected items) then this feature is suppressed.

* [U] Global registry value szSystemPropsList is a comma separated list of system properties to extend the file column and search attribute system. See here for the list of available properties: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd561977(v=vs.85).aspx . Some of them are already available as shell folder columns but some are only available through this route. Requires windows VISTA or later.

* in explorer replacement mode, "Open containing folder" menu command from 3rd party programs (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox) will correctly open and select items in xplorer². This is by far the most time consuming (wasted?) feature added in xplorer² in terms of development resources, enjoy!

* When you opt to replace windows explorer with xplorer² during installation, you get more folder types handled (including "virtuals" like MyComputer). Installer allows you to replace explorer for the current user or for all users with a tickbox. xplorer² is configured to automatically run when you boot up windows (silently).

* In the rare occasions when xplorer² cannot read a special folder (e.g. some items in control panel), you get the option to read it with windows explorer instead.


[2.4.0.1] 12 Nov 13 ----------------

* fixed some problems with windows 8.1 compatibility
* the poorly documented registry options szCustomDateFormat and szCustomTimeFormat (strings for date/time formatting different than that defined in control panel) are added to the advanced settings editor
* lengthy split/merge file operations (Actions menu) get a more responsive progress dialog (you still have to wait ages though :)
* Optional registry options szQVDraftExtList and szQVNativeExtList (see REGISTRY.TXT) control what extensions will get previewed for the Draft and Native preview tab respectively. So if you want to get just previews of JPG and TXT files in draft mode set szQVDraftExtList to "jpg,txt" (comma separated list of extensions, NO wildcards). These are layout specific, not for the global section. You can even have exclusion lists, e.g. "-jpg,-txt" will preview anything BUT jpg/txt.
* editor² gives a clearer warning when saving on a readonly file


[2.4.0.0] 6 Sep 13 ----------------

* [P] robust MOVE now works even if you are moving to the same partition (drive letter), as long as you specify a filter in the <F6> dialog. Supply a fake filter like "*" if you don't really need filtering but you need robustness. Note that this kind of Move operation is going to be SLOWER than a simple drag-drop on the same partition -- but you asked for it :)

* [P] registry option GIOPT_ROBUSTMOVE (=268435456) makes F6 move commands always go "robust" but at the great expense of speed. Available through Tools > Advanced options menu command (Layout page).

* [P] Robust file operations in silent mode are not halted for any messages as long as there are queued jobs waiting. This means you can queue jobs and go away. At the very end you will see a summary of errors (if any).

* Mark > Sync wizard dialog has a field to ignore a prescribed date difference (it applies when modification date is used for comparisons). Tick it to consider files within the specified date range as identical, or clear the checkbox to use the default +/- 2 seconds tolerance.

* [P] When using robust copy <F5>, if there is a filename collision (target file exists), you get a chance to supply a different filename so you can "manually" rename and keep the old target file or folder. Just type in the new filename (no path) and click on YES button. You don't need to type the extension even! The rename opportunity is offered when the copy options are set to "Ask confirmation" for overwriting existing objects.

* [P] Docking panes like tree have a PIN icon on their titlebar. If you click on the pin you toggle the autohide/docked mode. When set to autohide the panel is minimized, brought into view by hovering the mouse over the panel button (or clicking on the minimized button). Click on the titlebar pin again to fix the panel in docked (expanded) mode.

* Text extraction (search for keywords) works for PDF documents even if you have the latest Adobe reader — but it is recommended you switched to PDF X-change viewer especially if you are on 64 bit windows.

* Background context menu menu (when you click on empty space) on some virtual folders includes an NSE submenu that routes to some special namespace extension commands, e.g. add new secure FTP connection. Several special folders have such commands (requires windows Vista or later)

* [U] Tools > Fast search command more flexible when started from local folders outside the system index like C:\. It will search whatever folders are in the system index, under the current folder.

* Various small bugs fixed

* Quickviewer (Native mode) won't get in the way when renaming or deleting items; console window likewise won't block folder delete/rename operations

* Right click on a USB drive icon (e.g. on the drivebar or tree) and use EJECT context menu command to safely remove it. This ensures that xplorer² at least won't be locking it (but it could be locked by other applications on your system, try the Safe device removal icon on the taskbar notification area too)

* [P] AddressBar filter box works in miniscrap pane too (filter and select modes only), e.g. start typing a filename while the miniscrap has the focus and see what happens.

* Default document categories e.g. {pictures} are recognized as quick filters in the addressbar

* Symbolic links inherit the actual file dates at the time of creation (note the modification dates will diverge in the future)

* Subfolder sizes are calculated automatically (if relevant advanced option is set) even when you aren't in detailed view mode

* [P] Window > Set title menu command in scrap containers can be used to supply a custom titlebar name. You can also type your text in the addressbar as an alternative means of identification. Useful for multiple scrap windows.


[2.3.0.0] 1 Mar 13 ----------------

* Tools > Options menu, Advanced page has a button to access control panel's folder options. Note that some of these options have no effect on xplorer²

* Tools > Map network drive menu offers quick access to the respective windows function (also available by right clicking on My Computer icon)

* Tools > Options menu, Advanced page has a tickbox to make network access faster (plain icons, no overlays/tooltips/folder sizes, partial tree expansion). Combines the old advanced registry options GAOPT_TREENONETENUM and GAOPT_ECONOMYNETWD.

* [U] Tools > Fast search menu takes advantage of WDS v4.0 capability to search remote computers, if invoked while browsing some network folder. Likewise the Find Files command <ctrl+F> uses the remote computer search index if available. The remote folders must be shared.

* Right click menu in Draft quick viewer has option to show the end (tail) of files instead of the beginning. Only applies to plain text files

* If you don't have the NAME column first, the rename command <F2> uses a dialog window instead of failing.

* [P] Tools > Fuzzy groups menu command in a scrap window organizes the contents in groups according to how similar are their names (or any other text attribute). It can be used for fuzzy duplicate checking, e.g. how many folders you have that share a common artist name. For best results fiddle the fuzzy factor up/down.

* New filter box next to the addressbar allows quick selecting, filtering or [P] searching in the current view. Use the drop-down button menu to switch among the available modes and to fine-tune the operation. Press <ALT+Return> to operate on the inactive (dual) view. For more information please refer to the quickstart guide.

* registry option nCharsAutoFilter (available through the advanced settings editor: Layout settings > General). If your filter box is set to plain filename filtering, this setting controls after how many characters typed the focus will jump in the filter box, for easier visual filtering. Set to 0 to disable this function.

* Use the advanced registry settings editor (Layout settings > Main frame) to choose the relative size (percent) of the filter box in the addressbar. Set to 0 if you don't want the filter box.

* [P] smarter registration: if you copy the xplorer² unlock key from the email you receive when you buy xplorer², it will be automatically inserted in the registration dialog.

* Installer has option to add xplorer² to your folders' context menu. This can used as a soft alterative to replacing your windows explorer with xplorer².

* Double click on the filter icon on the statusbar to toggle the active filter. Double click on the "show hidden" status bar pane to toggle showing hidden files and folders.


[2.2.0.2] 14 Nov 12 ----------------

* Russian translation restored
* Fixed drivebar bug


[2.2.0.1] 6 Oct 12 ----------------

* [P] check duplicates command gets a prominent progressbar, useful for long file comparison operations

* [P] Customize > Keyboard hotkey control allows more key combinations to be used as accelerators (<Tab> etc). Navigating this dialog with the keyboard is a bit harder, sorry!

* Added new file attributes I for NOT content indexed (not that interesting :) and P for sParse files

* New tips: 4a, 27b, 46a, 124b, 125a, 161a, 167, 168, 169, 170

* [U] Tools > Find files menu command will use windows desktop search if available (requires windows XP with desktop search 4 installed). This will dramatically improve the search speed in indexed folders. For more accurate results use CLICK FOR ROBUST SEARCH button after the end of the quick search.
If you don't have desktop search, please download it from here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23

* [U] registry tweak GAOPT_NODESKSEARCH disables desktop search, xplorer² operates only with 'slow' search as it used to (available through Options > Advanced settings menu, Global page)

* [U] Tools > Fast search menu will do a simple desktop search under the current folder. Instead of defining complex search rules, just give it a keyword (whole word) to find either in the file contents, filename or some other file property. AQS syntax isn't supported, just plain text.

* [P] Tools > Save search (in a scrap window) saves the last search parameters (filter and location, not the results) to a file. Repeat an older search using Tools > Recent search menu. To start a saved search from the command line use the arguments /F:1 /L:path_to_saved_search.x2fnd (or double click on a *.x2fnd file)

* [P] Drag-drop a file on a filter window (e.g. find files dialog) and its details (name/date/size) are used to define a filter. Useful for locating renamed pictures from a camera.

* Edit > Copy to <F5> command offers to create a folder for the HERE field if it doesn't exist

* [P] Last complex filter (e.g. for <Alt+G> command remembered between sessions

* Tools > Options menu, Advanced page, has a tickbox for preserving file dates when setting comments with <Alt+Z>

* [P] Searches are now possible within external devices like phones and cameras

* [P] Drivebar won't show letters for empty card reader slots

* [P] Better estimation of time remaining for robust copy and delete commands


[2.1.0.2] 17 Apr 12 ----------------

* A few corrections for windows 8 compatibility


[2.1.0.1] 27 Mar 12 ----------------

* [U] Actions > Export settings menu asks you whether you want to export to INI (for portability) or to REG file. If you want to export the registry make sure you save settings in the registry (from Tools > Options > General)
* [P] Robust deletion dialog shows the path of the first few files/folders selected for deletion
* [P] You can click on the SHORTCUT TO property in the Details pane (if a link file is selected) to browse the target item


[2.1.0.0] 4 Mar 12 ----------------

* Added Downloads folder to system folders list (Goto > Special folders)
* [P] Right click menu in scrap containers includes command to Open file location (container folder) and one to remove items from view (equivalent to <DEL>).
* Tree option FTCOPT_AUTOCOLLAPSE (=256) collapses open branches before opening new ones - so that you don't end up with too many open branches during browsing
* Searching for text in files in RAW encoding mode preselects the case sensitive and search all files options, so that you can make the most of its powers (e.g. you can search for $EF$BB$BF to find all files that have the UTF-8 BOM marker).
* [P] double click on a dock pane's titlebar to make it float (toggle).
* Actions > Export settings and other similar input boxes have a [...] button that allow you easy path selection. Note that path autocompletion works there too.
* [P] Find files and similar dialogs allow regular expressions for filenames too (NAMED field). Set the fuzzines indicator to 0 (usually 100) to enable the regexp mode. For syntax see http://zabkat.com/x2h_2.htm#table1a
* [U] Tools > Options > General, save program state on exit possible to go to an INI file (instead of registry) for portability. The default location is the user settings folder (e.g. C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\zabkat. It could also be placed next to the program but make sure the folder is writeable (i.e. not while installed under C:\program files\zabkat). The /I: command line switch mainly caters for INI files, but it also supports REG files for compatibility with older xplorer² versions.
* [U] Advanced options editor can work with INI settings file, if passed as a command line argument, e.g. x2SettingsEditor.exe "C:\x2settings.ini" 
* Actions > Folder settings > Default menu command will fix the pane style, sort order, columns and grouping for all folders according to the current settings. Untick to revert to the classic 'last setting used is the default' mode. When the default mode is active, if you make any changes in some folder (e.g. switch to thumbnails) these will turn back to default once you browse some other folder.
* [P] show in groups mode now supports collapsible groups (windows vista and later), use the little group header icons to collapse and expand a group. WARNING: items in collapsed groups remain selected so be careful if you delete after collapsing a group!. To collapse/expand a group with the keyboard, select the group header then press left or right arrow keys respectively.
* registry setting CLVOPT_NOSELCOLLAPSED (=262144) forbids item selection when its group header is collapsed (see registry.txt)
* [P] <Ctrl+Shift+Left> arrow key collapses all groups (windows vista or later). To expand all groups press <Ctrl+R> to refresh the folder.
* editor² checks if a ED2.INI file exists next to the program (portable mode) and uses it automatically instead of registry. You can pass any custom settings file using the /I: option as before.
* Actions > Set comment menu command gets its own dialog. When you select multiple files to set, you have the option to either replace the existing comment verbatim, or you can just enter one word (tag) to add or remove from the existing comment
* [P] Plain text rules in hyperfilters support regular expressions if the relevant option is ticked.
* [P] View > Details pane menu command opens an information pane like that one in windows explorer, showing extended information on the focused item. This is a combination of quick content preview and file attributes, depending on the current file type. You can edit many properties 'in-place' by clicking on the IE-like anchor links. NOTE: this pane won't work perfectly if you have internet explorer 5 or earlier.
* Better icons for executable files and folders in thumbnail view mode
* [U] in portable trim, put a CIDA file next to the xplorer² executable to use it as the default contents file for the miniscrap pane.
* New demo videos added in Help > How do I? pane. Marked with NEW they hilight the biggest new additions
* New detail column (attribute) for MD5 file checksums (<Alt+K> command). The old plain checksum column works but it isn't very reliable identifying small differences. If you want to calculate MD5 sums of large files you may have to increase the relevant bytesize limit from Tools > Options, General page (near the bottom). Sorry, not working in windows 9x!
* [P] To customize the attributes that appear in View > Details pane put a HTML file called "X2DETAILS.HTM" in the installation folder. NOTE: this is an advanced operation for experienced users only.
* All program icons can be customized using the "translation" trick mentioned here:
	http://netez.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8379


[2.0.0.2] 25 Oct 11 ----------------

* a few small bugs fixed


[2.0.0.1] 20 Sep 11 ----------------

* registry tweak GAOPT_NOX2SHCMENU stops xplorer² adding its own menu items in the standard shell context menu (available through Options > Advanced settings, Global page)
* fixed a couple of bugs e.g. infotip formatting


[2.0.0.0] 22 July 11 ----------------

* [P] Native tab in quick previewer utilizes the windows vista/7 preview handlers for office/PDF/etc document preview (a lifesaver if you have the buggy Adobe X)
	download preview handler extensions http://www.smartftp.com/client/addons/sourcepreview/
* [P] Native preview automatically resizes images and text
* fast thumbnails for windows XP/2000 utilizing thumbs.db system cache (note: thumbnail size must be fixed to 96 pixels, see Tools > Options > General)
* option for large icons in folder tree (right click nowhere in tree and pick command from menu)
* large toolbar icons supported, create an alpha-transparent bitmap called x2skin_XL.PNG and put it in the  installation folder, see http://zabkat.com/x2skin.htm. Recommended icon sizes in range [24,48].
* when item icons are set to PLAIN (Tools > Options > General) there are no icon overlays extracted (shortcut, shared, TSVN etc)
* network folder access speed with tree-autosync enabled improved dramatically; make sure you have GAOPT_TREENONETENUM enabled from Tools > Advanced options (global page: tree only partially expands network folders)
* [P] Bookmarks > Dual submenu can save folders left/right (top/bottom) to be restored later as a set
* [P] Autofilters now hide folders in general, a separate menu command shows only folders
* Various list Organize dialogs are now resizable
* [P] infotip information available as a stock column too. Convenient for showing file type specific information (e.g. dimension for images, duration for music etc). Use <Alt+K> to place it on detailed view mode or on an infobar with right-click. Recommendation: use this as the ONLY piece of information on your infobars, removing all other columns.
* [P] robust copy and delete dialogs use checkbox to quickly activate last filter used (if any)
* [P] robust copy option to preserve all file/folder dates after copying (created etc). Normally only the last modified date is preserved.
* [P] shell context menu includes a custom xplorer² submenu where you can put any menu command to suit your needs (use Organize menu)
* Link icon overlays shown in thumbnail view mode too
* First stage (name parsing) of network reads also escapable (press ESC key if it takes too long)
* User command token $> for the odd (sic) need to pass all selected items through a list file. This is equivalent to $A token but the paths are saved to the file %TEMP%\x2tmpList.txt, then this file is used as the $> argument. Useful for situations where you need to pass too many files to some external tool.
* Toolbar context menu has switch whether to use small or large icons (if XL skin available)
* Improved handling of phones and digital cameras, now you can see thumnnails in such folders
* If in single pane mode, xplorer² window title shows the full folder path
* [P] Global registry setting nMenuBreak=X causes long menus e.g. Bookmarks to split vertically in columns every X items. To be used along nCustMenuIcons registry setting
* editor² optionally saves settings in a .INI file (instead of the registry) if you use the /I command line switch with a .INI filename
	Also loader automatically detects common unicode and UTF8 text files without a BOM
* [P] Actions > Folder settings > Save and Clear menu commands ask if you want to apply the same settings to all subfolders
* Search for text in plain text files (<ctrl+G>, Find files and similar commands) automatically detects unicode and UTF8 files even without a BOM (encoding identification)
* File > New tab opens all the selected items/folders in separate tabs
* Right click on a tab to lock it (toggle). Locked tabs stay put and any browsing in them results in opening a new tab.
* [P] all view panes (tree, quickviewer etc) are dockable. You can rearrange them by drag-drop to any side of the main window or have them floating (detached). Hold down <CTRL> while dragging to float a pane
* [P] View > Toolbars > Lock dock sites command fixes the arrangement of docking panes so that they cannot be moved. Dock bars also lose their titlebars if you long the way the old splitter panes looked like!
* [P] Clear contents context menu command in miniscrap pane deletes the default content file.
* [P] Free trial extended to 31 days (last 10 days have more nags/delays)
* [P] Your old xplorer² license key won't work but you may be entitled to a free or discounted upgrade, use the PURCHASE button in Help > About box to find out. If you bought xplorer² more than 2 years ago you'll need a new purchase.


[1.8.1.4] 24 Apr 11 ----------------

* slow startup on account of digital signature check eliminated
* added easter eggs -- only joking :)


[1.8.1.3] 6 Mar 11 ----------------

* [P] Help > Activate with key menu command easy way to use your unlock key to activate xplorer². This menu is disabled if you are already registered.
* Folder deletion from the tree got easier, now you don't have to activate the confusing 'Don't lock browsed folder' advanced option.
* Hide protected operating system files policy from Folder Options (Control panel) is observed, unless you use the registry tweak GIOPT_SHOWALLHIDDEN(=256) — then xplorer² will behave like it always had. (it only makes a difference for windows 7 and later)
* various small bugfixes (e.g. symbolic links)


[1.8.1.2] 25 Jan 11 ----------------

* added french translation - thanks to Denis Neuhart
* added spanish translation - thanks to Pablo Torralba Fernandez
* added brazilian translation - thanks to Emre Akkas [http://globalme.net]


[1.8.1.1] 21 Dec 10 ----------------

* bugfix for editor² UTF-8 file handling 
* hires toolbar skin available for editor² click here http://zabkat.com/skins/ed2skin.png

[1.8.1.0] 4 Dec 10 ----------------

* updated lists of recognized audio/video formats for WMP
* High color PNG toolbar skins supported, see several new skins available at http://zabkat.com/x2skin.htm
* /I: command line option for PORTABLE edition can take a standard INI (instead of REG) file so you can have your settings kept in a file without a round trip to windows registry
* Actions > Export settings menu command exports all the keys under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ZabaraKatranemia Plc to minimize on UAC confirmations
* [P] View > Visual filter > Autofilter command works in scrap windows too (for generic filters)
* registry option GIOPT_CACHETHUMBS(=524288) forces items to cache their bitmaps (not recommended!)
* vista/7 drag-drop images and labels closer to windows explorer format
* [P] robust copy shows progress on windows 7 taskbar button too (whoopy!)
* [P] drivebar supports right click context menu for all items (root drives)
* fast and sleek thumbnails for windows vista/7 using shell icon cache
* better appearence for windows vista/7 menu icons
* Help > Tell a friend menu command now leverages your social networking powers to spread the word on xplorer² (thanks! :)
* Help > Online support and Crash information now send emails to customer support
* [P] text rules in filters (e.g. Keywords) allow for ? and * wildcard characters, e.g. "ab?d" will match abCd, ab1d and abd.
* [P] Text filter rule dialog has a Verbatim checkbox; tick it to cancel wildcards, commas etc (find exactly what you type)
* numerous small bugs fixed and annoyances removed
* paste text and images in folder now creates unique names (x2scrap2.PNG etc)
* [P] Edit > Extract text command extracts plain unformatted text from documents, e.g. for a file called LETTER.DOC it will create LETTER.TXT with just the text contents. (windowsXP or later)
* registry option GAOPT_SAVEUNICODETXT available through registry settings editor (used for extract text and paste text as file commands)
* [P] new column for authenticode digital signature for executable files downloaded from the internet

[1.8.0.7] 23 February 10 ----------------

* quicker startup times (network folder icons for the tree done in background thread)


[1.8.0.5] 11 February 10 ----------------

* new status bar indicator for 'show hidden files' state
* more windows 7 warts eradicated
* keyboard only command <ctrl+alt+shift+H> to toggle show/hide hidden files (menuhack ID=33163)
* non-standard layouts easier to recognize from window title
* Window > Administrator menu command easy access to run xplorer² elevated when you need to write in C:\Program files and other locations normally blocked by UAC
* [P] column handlers like TSVN and audioshell now work for vista and windows 7!
* View > Select columns menu command has a filter box for easier column selection (for the 300-odd columns in W7!)
* [P] Additional rules definition (eg for <ctrl+F> find dialog) property is now combobox with autocomplete, e.g. type SVN and hit up-arrow to find a column that contains SVN in its name
* Explorer replacement mode (if selected from the installer) takes over HKCU\directory\shell\open key so more programs will use xplorer² for folders


[1.8.0.0] 25 November 09 ----------------

* Mark > Sticky selection now compatible with lasso mouse selection mode
* PNG, AVI and such files now can have comments attached (workaround); also commenting doesn't change file dates
